    <h1>love your clothes</h1>

    <p>Launched in 2014, the Love Your Clothes campaign has been developed together with industry organisations 
        to help change the way the UK consumers buy, use and dispose of their clothing.
        Love Your Clothes is part of the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP), which is coordinated by WRAP,
        a not-for-profit organisation which receives Government support across the UK.</p>

    <h2>Buying clothes</h2>

    <p>Loving your clothes starts with smarter buying. No more flimsy fabric and skimpy stitching 
    that falls apart the minute you get it home.</p>

    <p>Buying smarter can mean choosing clothes that are better made, 
        and that will be a doddle to care for. Or maybe you don’t need to buy at all – you could 
        hire or swap instead.Buying pre-loved clothes can also be a fabulous way of getting 
        a new look for a fraction of High Street prices. And vintage clothes mean you can be both chic and unique.</p>
